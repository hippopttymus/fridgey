PHOTO RESISTOR

  Use a photoresistor (light sensor) to control the brightness
  of a LED.

Hardware connections:

  Photo resistor:
  
    Connect one side of the photoresistor to 5 Volts (5V).
    Connect the other side of the photoresistor to ANALOG pin 0.
    Connect a 10K resistor between ANALOG pin 0 and GND.

    This creates a voltage divider, with the photoresistor one
    of the two resistors. The output of the voltage divider
    (connected to A0) will vary with the light level.
    
  LED:
  
    Connect the positive side (long leg) of the LED to
    digital pin 9. (To vary the brightness, this pin must
    support PWM, which is indicated by "~" or "PWM" on the
    Arduino itself.)

    Connect the negative side of the LED (short leg) to a
    330 Ohm resistor.

    Connect the other side of the resistor to GND.

  // as-is, the LED won't fully turn off, even in the dark.
  
  // You can accommodate the reduced range by manually 
  // tweaking the "from" range numbers in the map() function.
  // Here we're using the full range of 0 to 1023.
  // Try manually changing this to a smaller range (300 to 800
  // is a good guess), and try it out again. If the LED doesn't
  // go completely out, make the low number larger. If the LED
  // is always too bright, make the high number smaller.

  // change the values and try the program again until it works.
  // But why should you have to do that work? You've got a
  // computer in your hands that can figure things out for itself!

  // In this function, the Arduino will keep track of the highest
